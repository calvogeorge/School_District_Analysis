# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview

The school board has evidence of academic dishonesty in testing data of a group of students, although the extent of the academic dishonesty is not known, the school board want to uphold the state testing standards. The purpose of this project is to remove the potentially dishonest data. After removing the comprise data we will perform data analysis to show the impact on student performance of the schools budget, size and type.


## Results

As a result of removing the Thomas High School 9th grade students math and reading grades from the data we can answer the following questions:

* **How is the district summary affected?**

Removing the questionable grades did not have major impact on the district schools summary. There is only a neglegible differance between the Average Scores and Passing porcentage as show in tables 1.1 and 1.2 below.
